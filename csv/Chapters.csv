0,0,0,Overview of Atlantic,media/gulf_stream.png,Source: USGS,https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-north-atlantic-and-gulf-stream,"Climate scientists have come to the consensus that the increased melting of the ice caps in the north Atlantic, which has slowed down the movement of the gulf stream, has increased the rate of sea level rise in these particular areas. This essentially means that as the warmer water is trying to move further up itâ€™s getting slowed down by the increase in cooler water causing a higher concentration of water to build up along the east coast.",3,plain,blue,North Atlantic,35.5036,-69.42345,,,,

From the graph displayed, it depicts the City of Wilmington's rise in sea level. Since 1950, there has been a dramatic increase, with over an 11 inch rise in water levels.",10,plain,blue,"Wilmington, NC",34.20860292498924,-77.89353114975715,,,,

4,4,4,Project Results,media/combinedchart.JPG,Generated using matplotlib,https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html,"Percentage of Town Land Value Lost at Specific Elevations, found that 11.1% was lost at a 1 meter rise, 38.5% at a 2 meter rise, 35.8% at 3 meters, 14.2% at 4 meters, and 0.4% at 5 meters. The second pie chart, Percentage of Town Property Value Lost at Specific Elevations, found that 4.4% was lost at a 1 meter rise, 31.3% at a 2 meter rise, 44.7% at 3 meters, 19.1% at 4 meters, and 0.5% at 5 meters. Then finally, the total amount in USD, represented as a stacked bar graph, Value Lost at Each Meter in Sea Level Rise. Approximately $92 million dollars was lost at a 1 meter rise in sea levels, $392 million dollars lost at 2 meters, $437 million lost at 3 meters, $180 million lost at 4 meters, and $5 million at 5 meters. This totals to approximately $1.106 billion dollars in structural and land value lost. Total loss at 5 meters is unlikely, with only up to 2.1 meters by 2100 and 3.7 meters by 2150 at the highest level scenario. With intermediate projections, it is likely to only be 1.1 meters by 2100 and 2.1 meters by 2150, which is about $92 million to $484 million in total value lost.",12,hidden,blue,"Beaufort, NC",34.73133,-76.64585,,,geojson/Zonal Stats.geojson,fillColor:blue;color:black
