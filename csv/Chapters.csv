0,0,Overview of Atlantic,media/gulf_stream.png,Source: USGS,https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-north-atlantic-and-gulf-stream,"Climate scientists have come to the consensus that the increased melting of the ice caps in the north Atlantic, which has slowed down the movement of the gulf stream, has increased the rate of sea level rise in these particular areas. This essentially means that as the warmer water is trying to move further up itâ€™s getting slowed down by the increase in cooler water causing a higher concentration of water to build up along the east coast.",3,plain,blue,North Atlantic,35.5036,-69.42345,,,,

From the graph displayed, it depicts the City of Wilmington's rise in sea level. Since 1950, there has been a dramatic increase, with over an 11 inch rise in water levels.",10,plain,blue,"Wilmington, NC",34.20860292498924,-77.89353114975715,,,,
